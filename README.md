## Air Flow Simulation





FlowChecked aims to be the first step towards an airflow simulation to predict the propagation of airborne viruses in closed spaces. Our main goal is to create awareness among society and prevent new transmissions of coronavirus, by showing the dangers of enclosed activities. The project will reduce the risk of the spread of viruses such as COVID-19 by suggesting safer layout configurations and air conditioning systems designs that lower the risk of infection in indoor spaces.
